        <h5>Posted on 26 March in 2024</h5>
        
        <p>All programmers have a 2nd best game. So do I. My
            best game is the "Beaver go stick game".</p>
            <img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-images/3b60c165678e4ec51450747223e5c2a1fb6aa061.gif" alt="Beaver go stick game(beaver going up and down collecting sticks)" width
                ="350">
            
            <p>In level 1 we control a beaver and we have to
            help it by collecting sticks for it without making
            the beaver fall into the holes in the ground. In
            level 2 we help the beaver by avoiding bugs that try
            to eat the sticks of the beaver. We also cannot
            bring the beaver to land otherwise the sticks are 
            lost. I was very excited while making it.
            </p>
            <p>
            I had first thought of making holes as the obtacle
            in level 2 but that didnt work out. So I made the
            holes on ground that cut points. In level 2 I wanted
            to make holes on the ground but I didn't like that
            idea because I would get boring and a bit too easy. 
            So I cut points when the beaver hits the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
            I had posted this game on I hope I gave a good explanation about my game and 
            how I made it. Please do share your experience with
            me and give feedback. Thanks for reading!!
